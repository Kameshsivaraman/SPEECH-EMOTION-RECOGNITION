# SPEECH-EMOTION-RECOGNITION
MINI PROJECT 
ABSTRACT
Communication is a key to express one’s thoughts and ideas clearly. Amongst all forms of 
communication, Speech is the most preferred and powerful form of communication in humans. 
The era of the Internet of Things (IOT) is rapidly advancing in bringing more intelligent systems 
available for everyday use. Intelligent applications are interactive and require minimum user effort 
to function, and mostly function on voice based input. A speech percept can reveal information 
about the speaker including gender, age, language and emotion. The performance of speech 
emotion detection system can greatly influence the overall performance of the IOT application in 
many ways and can provide many advantages over the functionalities of these applications. This 
project presents a speech emotion detection system with improvements over an existing system in 
terms of data feature selection and methodology that aims at classifying speech percept based on 
emotions more accurately.
Speech Recognition through emotion is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion from 
speech. This is capitalizing on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone 
and pitch. In this Python mini project, we will use the libraries librosa for analyzing audio and 
music, soundfile to read .wav files for python-sound device and sklearn to build a model using an 
MLP Classifier Algorithm. We will load the data, extract features from it, then split the dataset 
into training and testing sets. Then, we’ll initialize an MLP Classifier and train the model. Finally, 
we’ll calculate the accuracy of our model. This have a wide range of applications in areas such as
education, entertainment, mental health monitoring, call-centers, e-learning, autonomous driver 
emotion detection, and physiological diseases analysis.
